# Case Background & Key Questions

Watson Health Insurance (WHI) is a growing private healthcare insurance provider. They were founded on the premise that using data and analytics can improve the health insurance industry by providing better care and offerings to its patients.

You have been tasked with analyzing the recently published results of this yearsâ€™ survey and providing your recommendations back to the Chief Analytics Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. You have been assigned the task of taking a first look at the data and beginning to answer several key questions:
1. How does health status, represented by average number of days with bad physical health in the past month (PHYSHLTH), differ by state? Also provide an indication of distribution using whatever statistics you find suitable. 
2.	Digging deeper into the data, what are some factors that impact health (i.e. demographics, behaviors, previous illness, etc.)? Recommend how your findings could be used to target different groups of people with different insurance products.
